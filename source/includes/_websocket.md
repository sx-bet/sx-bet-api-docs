# Websocket API

You can connect to the websocket API and listen for realtime changes in several things such as order books, markets, scores, and line updates.

## Initialization

```javascript
import * as ably from "ably";
import axios from "axios";

async function createTokenRequest() {
  const response = await axios.get(
    "https://api.sx.bet/user/token",
    {
      headers: {
        "x-api-key": process.env.SX_BET_API_KEY,
      }
    }
    
  );
  return response.data;
}

async function initialize() {
  const realtime = new ably.Realtime.Promise({
      authCallback: async (tokenParams, callback) => {
          try {
              const tokenRequest = await createTokenRequest() 
              // Make a network request to GET /user/token passing in 
              // `x-api-key: [YOUR_API_KEY]` as a header
              callback(null, tokenRequest)
          } catch (error) {
              callback(error, null)
          }
      }
  });
  await ablyClient.connection.once("connected");
}
```

We use the Ably SDK to allow users to connect to our API. It supports pretty much every major language but all of the examples on this page will be in JavaScript. The API is relatively identical across languages though. See [this link](https://ably.com/documentation/quick-start-guide) for a basic overview of the API in other languages.

<aside class="info">
You must have a valid API key to subscribe to realtime channels via the API.
</aside>

<aside class="warning">
You only need one instance of the <code>ably</code> object to connect to the API. Connections to multiple channels are multiplexed though the single network connection. If you create too many individual connections, you will be forcefully unsubscribed from all channels and disconnected.
</aside>

All the examples following assume you have a `realtime` object in scope following the initialization code to the right.

## Market updates

```javascript
const channel = realtime.channels.get(`markets`);
channel.subscribe((message) => {
  console.log(message.data);
});
```

> The above command returns JSON structured like this:

```json
[
  {
    "gameTime": 1625674200,
    "group1": "MLB",
    "homeTeamFirst": false,
    "leagueId": 171,
    "leagueLabel": "MLB",
    "line": 7,
    "liveEnabled": false,
    "marketHash": "0x384c6d8e17c9b5522a17f7bb049ede7d3dd9dd1311232fe854e7f9f4708dfc4c",
    "outcomeOneName": "Over 7.0",
    "outcomeTwoName": "Under 7.0",
    "outcomeVoidName": "NO_GAME_OR_EVEN",
    "sportId": 3,
    "sportLabel": "Baseball",
    "sportXeventId": "L7186379",
    "status": "ACTIVE",
    "teamOneName": "Tampa Bay Rays",
    "teamTwoName": "Cleveland Indians",
    "type": 2
  }
]
```

Subscribe to all changes in markets on sx.bet. You will get updates when

- A new market is added
- A market is removed (set to `INACTIVE`)
- A market's fields have changed (for example, game time has changed or the market has settled)

### Channel name format

`markets`

### Message payload format

See [the markets section](#get-specific-markets) for the format of the message

## Parlay Market requests

```javascript
const channel = realtime.channels.get(`markets:parlay`);
channel.subscribe((message) => {
  console.log(message.data);
});
```

> The above command returns JSON structured like this:

```json
{
  "marketHash": "0x38cceead7bda65c18574a34994ebd8af154725d08aa735dcbf26247a7dcc67bd",
  "baseToken": "0x8f3Cf7ad23Cd3CaDbD9735AFf958023239c6A063",
  "requestSize": "100000000",
  "legs": [
    {
      "marketHash": "0x0d64c52e8781acdada86920a2d1e5acd6f29dcfe285cf9cae367b671dff05f7d",
      "bettingOutcomeOne": true,
    },
    {
      "marketHash": "0xe609a49d083cd41214a0db276c1ba323c4a947eefd2e4260386fec7b5d258188",
      "bettingOutcomeOne": false,
    }
  ]
}
```

When a bettor requests a Parlay Market, a message is sent via the `markets:parlay` channel. In order to offer orders on Parlay Markets, you will need to subscribe to this channel. The payload will contain the `marketHash` that is associated with the Parlay Market. 

You can post orders to this market as you would for any other market, using this `marketHash`. The payload also contains the token and size that the bettor is requesting. The `legs` in the payload contain the underlying legs that make up the parlay market. You can query for market data on each leg's `marketHash` to determine current orders for that individual market.

### `ParlayMarket` payload format

| Name          | Type              | Description                                                                                                                           |
| ------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| baseToken     | string            | The token this request is denominated in                                                                                              |
| requestSize   | number            | The size in baseTokens that the bettor is requesting. See [the token section](#tokens) of how to convert this into nominal amounts    |
| legs          | ParlayMarketLeg[] | An array of legs that make up the parlay                                                                                              |

### `ParlayMarketLeg` payload format

| Name                  | Type    | Description                                                             |
| --------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| marketHash            | string  | The market for an individual leg within the parlay                      |
| bettingOutcomeOne     | boolean | The side the bettor is betting for an individual leg within the parlay  |

<aside class="notice">
Note that the `requestSize` is only indicating what the user is requesting, but does not limit market makers in how much they want to offer. You are allowed to offer any size.
</aside>


## Line changes

```javascript
const channel = realtime.channels.get(`main_line`);
channel.subscribe((message) => {
  console.log(message.data);
});
```

> The above command returns JSON structured like this:

```json
{
  "marketHash": "0x38cceead7bda65c18574a34994ebd8af154725d08aa735dcbf26247a7dcc67bd",
  "marketType": 3,
  "sportXeventId": "L7178624"
}
```

Subscribe to all line changes. Messages are sent for particular combinations of event IDs and market types. Note that only market types with lines will have updates sent. See [the active markets section](#get-active-markets) for details on which types have lines.

### Channel name format

`main_line`

### Message payload format

| Name          | Type   | Description                                             |

To get the actual line, you'll have to fetch the market using the `marketHash`

Subscribe to changes in a particular user's orders. You will receive updates when orders are filled, cancelled, or posted. Note that for performance reasons, updates are delayed by at most 100ms.

### Channel name format

`active_orders:{token}:{user}`

### Message payload format

The order is packed into an array and the fields are sent in the below order, with the 0th index as the first row. Note that these are the same fields as mentioned in the [the orders section](#get-active-orders), with an additional `status` and `updateTime` field.

Note that the messages are sent in batches in an array. If you receive two updates for the same `orderHash` within an update, you can order them by `updateTime` after converting the `updateTime` to a BigInt or BigNumber.
